            Municipality of the Norwegian county of Troms og Finnmark. The
            municipality's and Troms County's administrative hubs are located in
            the same city. At the city's Troms Cathedral, the Diocese of
            Nord-Hlogaland and its Bishop are housed. The city is situated on
            the island of Tromsya, which is just off the coast of Northern
            Norway's mainland in the Tromsysundet strait. The Troms Bridge and
            the Tromsysund Tunnel link the city centre on Tromsya to the
            mainland suburb of Tromsdalen. The Sandnessund Bridge connects the
            neighbourhood of Kvalysletta on the island of Kvalya to the downtown
            area.
